### Course Outline:

The explosion of accessible digital text is rapidly changing the work of researchers interested in studying  culture, decision making and human interaction. For example, the narratives, debates, laws, and opinions that form the core of political discourse are predominantly text-based, emphasizing the need to understand what is being communicated and written. These data provide a complementary dimension to the more traditional, structured datasets typically used in social science research. From analyzing news articles and social media posts to understand public sentiment and opinion, to examining online forums and comment sections to gain insights into community dynamics and social issues, the applications of text analysis are broad and impactful.

This graduate-level course provides an overview and hands-on experience of the methods that comprise the essential toolkit for text analysis. Aimed at equipping students with practical skills, the course covers a wide range of topics, including data collection strategies and ethical considerations related to text analysis. From the perspective of social science researchers, the course explores various methods to discover patterns, measure variables of interest, and assess causal relationships using textual data. Through theoretical discussions, engagement with recent literature, and practical exercises, students will gain the necessary knowledge and expertise to effectively analyze text data in their own research.
